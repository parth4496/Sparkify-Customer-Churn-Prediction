## Motivation
  Sparkify Customer Churn Prediction is a project done as a part of Capstone Project in the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The project aimed at solving a business problem related to identfying customers that are likely to churn using their activity data. It requires me to understand customer behavior pattern from last 2 months of data.
  
## Software and Libraries
  For this project, I have used Python, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Spark, PySpark, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Many other machine learning libraries have also been used perform essential functions of the project.
  
  This project could have also been done using cloud services like AWS/IBM/GCP/Azure with full dataset and employing clusters.
  
  
## Files
- Sparkify.ipynb : Jupyter notebook consisting all the codes and work for project
- README.me : readme file as in this file
- json file consisting data
- Blog [Link] (https://patel-parth4496.medium.com/sparkify-customer-churn-prediction-559b214c64ed)

## OutCome
  The outcome for this project can be stated as a machine learning model which is strongest in predicting if a customer churn's or not.
